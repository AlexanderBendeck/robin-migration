<b>Welcome!</b> This tool allows you to explore migration patterns in the United States at the county level. <br><br> In "individual county" mode, clicking on an individual county will show migration patterns into or out of that county. Using the options in the sidebar, you can select the direction of migration (in or out), color of counties on the map, and more. After clicking on a county, you can hover over counties on the map or points in the scatterplot at the bottom right of the screen to reveal additional details.
In "attribute" mode, you can choose an attribute of interest such as voting in Presidential elections or median household income, which will show migration patterns into or out of the group of counties with the attribute of interest. There are additional options in the sidebar to specify this attribute. From here, clicking on a county will show only the migration flow into or out of the counties with the attribute of interest.
To see what kinds of insights you can gain from using this tool, jump right in and click on a county in "individual county" mode. If you're not sure where to start, take a look at some snapshots that have already been submitted.
