People moving to suburban counties often come from (nearby) urban counties. In the 1950s, this process was known as "white flight", and over time it left the inner cities with less public investment. Today, some "gentrified" cities offer cheaper rent in the suburbs. In general, suburbs offer larger houses which attract growing families, but a car is needed to get around.
Where do movers from politically "moderate" counties end up? Most are from the Northeast and Midwest, and they move to red areas in Florida and Texas, which additionally have low land costs and low property taxes. This move from the post-industrial "Rust Belt" to the warmer "Sun Belt" has been occurring since the 1970s. Movers are known as snowbirds, many of whom are retirees.
